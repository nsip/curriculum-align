(ACSHE120, ACSHE135) Students: a. identify that most energy conversions are inefficient and lead to the production of heat energy, eg in light bulbs   b. research ways in which scientific knowledge and technological developments have led to finding a solution to a contemporary issue, eg improvements in devices to increase the efficiency of energy transfers or conversions     c. discuss the implications for society and the environment of some solutions to increase the efficiency of energy conversions by reducing the production of heat energy     Additional content  Additional content is not prerequisite knowledge for following stages, but may be used to broaden and deepen students' skills, knowledge and understanding in Stage 4. Students: \u00f1 investigate characteristics of specific forces in terms of size and direction \u00f1 investigate some simple machines, eg levers, pulleys, gears or inclined planes \u00f1 trace the history of the development of particular devices or technologies, eg circuitry through to microcircuitry \u00f1 describe the scientific principles used in some traditional technologies used and developed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples   \u00f1 trace the history of pendulum-motion studies and its connection with timekeeping and setting standards of length \u00f1 debate intergenerational implications of the use of non-renewable energy resources       \u00f1 research current ideas about the Earth's magnetic field and its effects ",
