# curriculum-align
Web service to align free text to curriculum standards as document classification

This code builds on https://github.com/nsip/curriculum-mapper, putting in place a 
document classifier (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tfâ€“idf) to classify arbitrary
text as aligning to the curriculum items the code is provisioned with,
and outputting the alignments as a web service.

The web service runs on port 1576, and takes the following arguments:

````
GET http://localhost:1576/curriculum?yr=X,Y,Z&area=W&text=....
````
where _yr_ is the year level (and can be comma-delimited), _area_ is the learning area, and _text_ is the text to be aligned. The _area_ and _text_ parameters are obligatory.

The response is a JSON list of structs with the following fields:

* item: the identifier of the curriculum item whose alignment is reported
* text: the text of the curriculum item whose alignment is reported
* score: the score of the alignment

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum:

> The word "curriculum" began as a Latin word which means "a race" or "the course of a race" (which in turn derives from the verb _currere_ meaning "to run/to proceed"). The first known use in an educational context is in the [_Professio Regia_](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bG5EAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=el&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=curriculum&f=false), a work by University of Paris professor [Petrus Ramus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrus_Ramus) published [posthumously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre) in 1576.
